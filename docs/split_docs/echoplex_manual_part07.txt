FeedBkCont Default: 1 Parameter Row: MIDI 
Choose a MIDI Controller for Feedback 
Values: 0-99 
This function lets you pick which MIDI Continuous Controller will control feedback. The feedback value can be controlled by MIDI, by the Feedback Knob on the front panel, or by a volume pedal connected to the Feedback Jack on the back panel. 
See the explanation of the Feedback Knob in this chapter for the most detailed explanation of feedback.

Default: Rehearse InsertMode Parameter Row: Switches 
Affects the behavior of the Insert button 
Values: Rehearse (rhr), Replace (rPL), Substitute (Sub), HalfSpeed (h.SP), Reverse (rEV), Insert (InS), Sustain (SUS) 
InsertMode redefines the function of the Insert button so that different functions can be available from the front panel according to your needs. All of these functions are also available independently by MIDI. 

INSERTMODE=REHEARSE 
When used in Play mode, Rehearse has the same meaning as if InsertMode=Insert, described fully under the Insert heading. 
The effect of InsertMode=Rehearse is felt when you end a Record with the Insert button. The cycle that youve just recorded will be played back exactly once, regardless of the feedback setting. The underlying timing of the cycle will continue and any new audio played is fed into the loop. If you play something that you really like and want to keep for more repetitions, press Insert again immediately after youve played it. One cycles worth of material prior to that point will be kept as the loop, and will repeat according to the feedback setting. 
Rehearse is useful for practicing an idea before keeping it as the loop. 
See Rehearse in the Functions section for more information. 

INSERTMODE=INSERT 
When used in Play mode, this causes you to go into Insert mode when the Insert button is pressed, fully described under the Insert heading in this chapter. 
Reference - Parameters 4-11 
InsertMode 
Continued 
If InsertMode=Insert, pressing Insert at the end of a Record ends the recording and immediately inserts a second cycle (as it continues recording); in other words, it puts you into Insert mode. The insertion continues until memory runs out or you end it with Insert or an alternate ending for the Insert operation. This is very useful for dividing a longer loop into multiple cycles as you record it. This can allow you to easily set a tempo for an external sequencer when using MIDI clock out, for example. 
See Insert in the Functions section for more information. 

INSERTMODE=REPLACE 
When InsertMode=Replace, the Insert button becomes the Replace button. Each press and release of the Replace button during Play mode will replace a segment of the loop with new material for as long as Replace is held down. The overall loop length is not changed. 
If Quantize=On and Replace is pressed during a cycle, the function will begin at the end of the current cycle, and will continue to the next cycle point after Replace is released again. 
When InsertMode=Replace and Insert is used as an alternate ending during a Record, the Record ends as if youd pressed the Record button and the Replace function immediately begins as explained above. 
See Replace in the Functions section for more details. 

INSERTMODE=SUBSTITUTE 
When InsertMode=Substitute, the Insert button becomes the Substitute button during Play mode. Substitute has some similarity to the Replace function. However, with Substitute the original loop playback continues

while you are playing the new material. On the next repetition, only the new audio will remain in the loop and the old portion will be removed. 
See Substitute in the Functions section for more details. 

INSERTMODE=HALFSPEED 
When InsertMode=HalfSpeed, the Insert button becomes the HalfSpeed button during Play mode. Pressing HalfSpeed switches the current loop an octave lower, to half speed. The Insert LED turns red and the display says H.SP briefly. Press HalfSpeed again and the loop returns to FullSpeed. The LED turns green and F.SP is displayed for a moment. 
See HalfSpeed in the Functions section for more details. 

INSERTMODE=REVERSE 
When used in Play mode, Reverse causes the current loop to be played backwards. 
When InsertMode=Reverse and Insert is used as an alternate ending during a Record, the Record ends and reversed playback starts immediately. 
See Reverse in the Functions section for more details. 
InsertMode 
Continued 

INSERTMODE=SUSTAIN 
InsertMode=Sustain changes the way the Insert and Multiply buttons work. SUS turns Insert and Multiply into Unrounded functions with Sustain action on the button. In other words, they start when the button is pressed and end immediately when it is released, just like Record or Overdub do when RecordMode or OverdubMode=SUS. When the function ends it does so as if Record had been pressed as an alternate ending to the Insert. This is what we call an Unrounded Multiply or Unrounded Insert, because instead of rounding off to the next Cycle point it is ended immediately and the loop time is redefined. 
See SUS Commands in the Functions section for more details.

Default: Loop Loop/Delay (InterfaceMode) Parameter Row: Timing 
Switch between loop and digital delay applications. 
Values always available: Loop (LOP), Delay (dEL), Expert (EXP), Stutter (Stu) 
Values also available with a pedal inserted: Out (Out), Input (In), Replace (rPL), Flip (FLI) 
The Loop/Delay parameter determines how feedback, Loop Input Volume, and Loop Output Volume are controlled during various states. The parameter affects how you interact with and control the loop, and different settings will be more or less useful to different players and different styles of looping. We call these InterfaceModes. 
Basically, InterfaceModes reroute the control signals from the Feedback Knob on the front panel and the Feedback Pedal Jack on the back, and determine when they are active and which parameters they control. In some cases these settings end up affecting Insert in interesting ways as well. 
There were only three settings in previous versions of the Echoplex  LoopMode, DelayMode, and OutMode. LoopMode has always been the default setting and most people use it. DelayMode is there to give a familiar style of operation to people accustomed to using delays. OutMode was only available if a pedal was inserted in the Feedback Pedal Jack, and is really just like LoopMode but with Loop Output Volume controlled by the pedal while Feedback was controlled by the Feedback Knob. 
Now we have added several new options to allow new ways to interact with the loop, for a total of eight. Four of the InterfaceModes are available at any time, and four require a pedal to be inserted in the Feedback Pedal Jack. Those four are not visible in the parameter selection unless the pedal is connected. 
These InterfaceModes are really expert functions, for experienced users to find subtle new ways to interact with loops. For newer or less experienced users, we recommend that you stay with LoopMode until you feel ready to experiment with the other InterfaceModes. 

Loop/Delay (InterfaceMode)

LOOPMODE (LOOP/DELAY =LOP) 
LoopMode is the default setting for the Loop/Delay parameter, and is the most common way of using the Echoplex. This is the InterfaceMode we recommend people to start with, and most people stay with it. 
In LoopMode the Feedback control is always active, whether Overdubbing or not. Feedback is controlled by the front panel Feedback Knob if there is no pedal inserted, or by a pedal in the Feedback Pedal Jack. Loop Input Volume and Loop Output Volume are fixed all the way on or off depending on the function, so these are being set for you according to what you are doing. 
The following table shows how Feedback, Loop Input Volume, and Loop Output Volume are set in various states.
