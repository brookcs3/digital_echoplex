INPUTMODE (LOOP/DELAY =In) 
The In choice for the Loop/Delay parameter is only available when a pedal is plugged into the Feedback Pedal Jack. InputMode behaves just like LoopMode except that the pedal controls the Loop Input Volume in the states where the input is open. Feedback is only controlled by the

front panel FeedBack Knob. InputMode does not exist without a Pedal connected.

REPLACEMODE (LOOP/DELAY =rPL) 
In ReplaceMode the pedal controls Loop Output Volume and Feedback simultaneously. The result is similar to LoopMode, except that you hear the reduction for Feedback immediately instead of on the next loop pass. 
ReplaceMode makes it easier to "sculpt" the loop using the Feedback 
control. If you have Overdub on, the pedal serves as a Replace function Reference - Parameters 4-23

with smooth level control. This allows you to add new material and smoothly drop out the loop underneath you as it is Overdubbed, allowing for a smooth real-time Replace. 
The disadvantage of ReplaceMode is that if the pedal is in the toe-up position, the Loop Output Volume is also zero, so it is not possible to create loops with only single repetitions. ReplaceMode is also less interesting for any loops relying on reduced Feedback settings, since the output is affected. 
ReplaceMode does not exist without a Pedal connected to the Feedback Pedal Jack.

FLIPMODE (LOOP/DELAY =FLI) 
FlipMode is an unusual and interesting InterfaceMode, in that the pedal controls both Loop Input Volume and Feedback simultaneously. The interesting thing is that Feedback on the pedal is reversed! When the pedal is all the way in the toe-up position, the Loop Input level is zero and the feedback is at 100%. When the pedal is all the way in the toe-down position, the loop input is at 100%, but the feedback goes to 0. 
In use this is like a Hold pedal, but with a more fluid action. You can also think of the pedal as a soft replace since operating the pedal lets you smoothly crossfade a replacement section into your loop. 


USING FLIPMODE 
To get the hang of FlipMode, use loops of about 1 second, keep the pedal in the toe-up position most of the time, and turn the front panel FeedBack Knob to zero. Set the loop time with a couple presses of Record, and experiment with the pedal as you play new material. 
To record an ordinary loop in FlipMode, put the pedal in the toe-down position and end Record with Overdub. 
In Overdub the Feedback is taken from the front panel FeedBack Knob (which also operates in reverse!), so once you've made an interesting loop by crossfading in Play, you can keep it by pressing Overdub. You can then Overdub onto it using the pedal to control the Loop Input Volume. 
By setting the front panel FeedBack Knob you can make the Overdub state into a simple delay, which can be used as a contrast to the unusual crossfade effect. 
Other functions interact with FlipMode as follows. 

Loop/Delay (InterfaceMode)

n  Multiply allows you to continue to crossfade over repetitions of your loop.  
n  Insert does a SingleCycleMultiply (as described under StutterMode), so you can Overdub onto repeats of the next Cycle in the loop. (Remember you can hit Undo to end the SingleCycleMultiply and not keep the stutters in the loop).  
n  Mute allows you to build up a crossfaded loop without hearing it and then bring it in at once.  

FlipMode does not exist without a Pedal connected.

USING THE INTERFACE MODES WITH A STEREO ECHOPLEX SETUP 
Many of the InterfaceModes require a pedal connected to the Feedback Pedal Jack in order to be available at all, and use that pedal as a key part of their functionality. This causes a problem with the traditional Echoplex Stereo setup, where a pedal is only connected in the Master side, and all value changes made with it are sent to the Slave Echoplex by MIDI. With the alternate InterfaceModes, the slave in such a setup will not have a pedal inserted and it can not be set to the InterfaceModes requiring a pedal. The slave will only cycle through the first four InterfaceModes, while the master cycles through all 8.  
There are a few ways to work around this problem.
