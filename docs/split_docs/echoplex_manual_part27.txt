4. 
Press Mute, then Multiply. 

5. 
Press the footswitch. The loop youve just recorded will start playing back from the beginning and play once. Every time you press the footswitch, the loop will restart from its beginning. 



Example 4.x: Audio-Controlled Stuttering (Mute/Multiply) 
1. 
Connect a microphone to the BeatSync jack. (You could also use an aux send of a mixer that has the microphones connected to it.) 

2. 
Place the mic near an appropriate sound source that can give a sharp attack, like a drum for example. 


3. Set Sync=In. 
4. 
Record a loop. 

5. 
Press Mute, then Multiply. 

6. 
Every time the drum is struck, your loop will trigger and play once.

7. This can also be done with guitars, bass, drum machines, audio outputs of metronomes, etc. Any audio source that can give a sufficient pulse will work.

Synchronization BrotherSync Back Panel 
Synchronizes multiple Echoplexes at the sample level, while allowing any one of them to define the basic cycle length for the group. Especially useful for stereo recording, multi-track looping, and jamming with multiple Echoplex users. 
The BrotherSync jack accepts a 1/4" stereo (TRS) phone plug. 
BrotherSync provides the tightest possible synchronization among multiple Echoplexes. It maintains synchronization at the sample level. Among other things, this enables you to use two Echoplexes to record the separate halves of a stereo signal. When locked together with BrotherSync, the units will remain in lockstep, without even shifting phases between them over 198-second loops. Figure 2.4 on page 2-8 is a diagram of exactly how best to accomplish this. 
You can use stereo Y-cords to connect the BrotherSync jacks of many Echoplexes. On each unit, set Sync=out and reset the current loop. From then on, any unit can define the basic cycle time just by recording a loop. The other units can then be synchronized to that loop time or a multiple of it. Have an Echoplex jam session! If you think that the Echoplex opens up a lot of possibilities for a single player, imagine the possibilities for multiple performers. 
If you are also using MIDI Clock from another device, note that if a MIDI clock is received at the MIDI In Port, BrotherSync input is ignored 


Example 4.x: Synchronizing Two Echoplexes with BrotherSync 
1. 
Connect a 1/4" stereo (TRS) cable between the BrotherSync jacks of the two Echoplexes. 

2. 
Set Sync=Out on both Echoplexes. 

3. 
Put the current loop of both units into reset. 

4. 
Record a loop in one of the Echoplexes. You will see the Sync LED flash on the other.

5. 
Somewhere in the middle of the master loop, press Record on the 2nd Echoplex. The display will show "ooo," indicating that the Echoplex is waiting for a sync pulse before recording. 

6. 
When the loop on the first reaches its start point, the second will start recording. 

7. 
Press Record again to stop recording. The display will show "ooo," and recording will continue until the next pulse comes in. You can wait longer than one cycle to press Record the second time. The second unit will count cycles in the Multiple display and round off when you do press Record. In this way you can have synchronized loops on different units that are multiples of each other. 

8. 
Now repeat the above, but this time start with the second unit. Notice how any of the units can create the basic cycle for the others to follow. This is why it is called BrotherSync! 



Comparison of BeatSync and BrotherSync 
When connecting Echoplexes to each other, BrotherSync synchronizes loop times and start points. It provides a tight, sample-level sync between units. It is peer-to-peer, in that any of the Echoplexes can define the loop time for the others. 
BeatSync allows you to synchronize loops to external sync pulses from other devices or send sync pulses out to them. It can also sync to audio pulses, like a kick drum. It is not intended for synchronizing to other Echoplexes and only operates in one direction at a time.

Synchronization Global/Local MIDI Clock 
Clock mechanism that allows synchronization magic in the Echoplex. 
The Echoplex uses a Global/Local MIDIclock system that allows the slaved unit to lock up with an external sequencer without drifting, even if the loop start point on the Echoplex is moved by one of the following de.aligning functions: 
n StartPoint 
n Sample Triggering 
n Mute-Undo (restart loop) 
n Reverse 
n HalfSpeed 
n NextLoop (Each loop keeps its own local MIDIclock counter) 
n Stopping and restarting the sequencer or drum machine 
This feature lets you shift the loop freely away from the downbeats of an external sequencer for interesting rhythmic effects. All the while, the Echoplex keeps track of the external sequencers downbeat and clock as a Global clock, and the local Loops StartPoint as a Local clock. This allows for incredible new capabilities in the Echoplex to shift loops out of alignment from each other without losing sync, and then ReAlign them perfectly with each other again at will! 
After de-aligning the loop, the original alignment of the Loop StartPoint with MIDI beat 1 can be restored with the new ReAlign functions or with Reset. ReAlign is available as the Mute-Multiply combination on the front panel, or directly by MIDI. See the ReAlign section for more details. 
All the following functions serve to bring the loop together with the sequencer again, once the loop has been de-aligned by one of the functions above: 

n  Reset (start a new loop with the StartPoint at MIDI beat 1)  
n  ReAlign (Restart the current loop at the next MIDI beat 1)
