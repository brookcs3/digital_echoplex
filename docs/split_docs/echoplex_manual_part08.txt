Loop/Delay (InterfaceMode)

DELAY MODE (LOOP/DELAY =dEL) 
DelayMode operation is like a traditional delay, and is useful for people familiar with that style of looping. In a traditional delay, the input to the delay line is always open and Feedback is always being applied. When a Hold button is pressed, the input to the delay is closed, and the Feedback is set to 100%. 
Therefore, when the Echoplex is in DelayMode it acts much like a traditional delay. You set (and reset) the delay time by a pair of presses on the Record button. The Loop Input Volume is always open and Feedback is controlled by the front panel Feedback Knob. Youll probably want to keep the Feedback Knob set fairly low when you use the delay function. 

In DelayMode, some actions have different effects than in LoopMode.  
n  The Overdub button becomes the Hold button. When you press Overdub the Feedback is set to 100% for infinite repeats and the Loop Input Volume is closed so that no new material is recorded into the delay. This is different from the LoopMode style, where Feedback is always available to control independently of whether Overdub is on or not.  
n  Hold also works while Multiplying and while the loop is Muted.  
n  Any pedal attached to the Feedback Jack will control the Loop Input Volume to the delay rather than Feedback. This is useful as a way to do volume swells into the delay line.  
n  Feedback will only be controllable with the front-panel Feedback Knob.  

The following table shows how Feedback, Loop Input Volume, and Loop Output Volume are set in various states.

EXPERTMODE (LOOP/DELAY =EXP) 
ExpertMode uses the pedal for Feedback during play and the front panel FeedBack Knob for Feedback during Overdub, Multiply, and Substitute. This allows you to have different Feedback settings between playing and overdubbing. When there is no pedal connected to the Feedback Pedal Jack, the Feedback during play is always set to maximum (100%).

STUTTERMODE (LOOP/DELAY =Stu) 
StutterMode is just like LoopMode, except that Insert works as what we call a SingleCycleMultiply. 
SingleCycleMultiply works as follows. When you have done a Multiply and have several Cycles in a loop, pressing Insert will insert repetitions of the next Cycle. As the inserts are made you can overdub a longer phrase over the repetitions of the Cycle. The results will be inserted into the loop when you press Insert again. If you press Undo instead, the loop will return to its original form. 
Using Insert-Undo like this lets you alter the flow of a loop by having one of the Cycles Stutter in a way similar to a skipping CD, and then return to the original. This can make very interesting results when working with very short Cycles, and that is why it is called StutterMode.

STUTTER AND LOOPCOPY 
Stutters can be done into a new loop as a LoopCopy function when in StutterMode. With multiple loops set up in MoreLoops, and SwitchQuant=On, pressing Next-Insert will do the stutter into a new loop. Any new material you play will be overdubbed on this loop as it stutters. And as before, you keep it with another press of Insert. Pressing Undo sends you back to where you were in the previous loop. Copying a stutter is a good way to preserve the original loop while making stuttered variation out of a fragment from it. 


MANAGING MEMORY IN STUTTERMODE 
If you perform a very large number of repetitions of Insert and Undo button presses to trigger and cancel the SingleCycleMultiply, you may eventually notice bits of the loop being erased by the Undo presses as well. This is a result of the way the Echoplex processes its memory. If you're planning to do heavy Insert + Undo button combinations with SingleCycleMultiply, you should be aware of this, and consider copying your loop via NextLoop and LoopCopy before doing intensive Stutter work, so you can return to the original loop fully intact if you wish. 
Another trick you can do to avoid the loss of the overdubs is to first fill a bit of memory reserve by letting the loop repeat a few times without AutoUndo. (Without the left green dot AutoUndo LED blinking.) You can do this by reducing Feedback a little bit for a few repetitions, say to 120  125. That is small enough that the fading will not be obvious over a couple of repetitions, but you will force the Echoplex to copy the loop a few times into new memory. Obviously by doing this you lose some of the older stuff in memory, which you will note if you later want to go backwards with Undo. The reasons why this works are very complicated, but suffice to say that you will not find bits of your loop disappearing when doing heavy stuttering effects! 


SUBSTITUTE AND STUTTERMODE 
Substitute gains more advanced control in StutterMode. If you have a Pedal inserted in the Feedback Pedal Jack for Feedback control, the pedal controls the Feedback during normal use and the knob setting is

not used. However, during Substitute the FeedBack Knob becomes active for Feedback control. This lets you have two different Feedback settings between normal playing and Substituting. If you do not have a pedal inserted, Substitute operates the way it normally does in LoopMode and has Feedback set to 0 while active. See the Substitute section to learn more about this function. 
The following table shows how Feedback, Loop Input Volume, and Loop Output Volume are set in various states.

OUTMODE (LOOP/DELAY =Out) 
The Out choice for the Loop/Delay parameter is only available when a pedal is plugged into the Feedback Pedal Jack. This state is identical
