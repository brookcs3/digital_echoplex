loop to finish, Overdub will be on when you go to the second loop. Again, it will not return to the first loop after it is done, and the overdub is kept. 
NextLoop: NextLoop is interesting. If you press NextLoop again while the second loop is playing, you will go to a third loop. When the third loop is finished playing once, it returns to the second loop. When the second loop finishes playing one more time, it returns to the first loop! So you can stack up a sequence of jumps and then return to the beginning, all automatically! There is a limit to this, in that you cant NextLoop through the same loop several times and automatically jump back to it that many times. It will stop the first time it returns to that loop and ignore previous steps in the sequence. 
Record: If you press Record while the second loop is playing, you will record a new one. It will continue repeating instead of jumping back to the first loop. 
AutoRecord: If the loop you jump to with SamplerStyle=Once is in reset and AutoRecord=on, you record the B part and immediately jump back to the previous loop when you tap Record to finish. If you press some additional function during recording for an alternate ending (like Multiply or Insert), it will go ahead and do that function and stay in the second loop. There is a limitation with AutoRecord and several loops. If you use AutoRecord to record several loops it will only jump back one loop at the end instead of jumping back through all of them. 
LoopCopy and TimeCopy: If you have LoopCopy on or if you engage a LoopCopy by pressing Multiply, Insert, or Overdub when using SwitchQuantize to change loops, the copy will be made into the new loop. When you finish the copy with a press of Multiply (or Insert) it will jump back to the first loop. This is an interesting way to make copies into a new loop and not necessarily listen to it repeat immediately. 
Similarly, if you press any additional function during the quantizing period, it does not switch back to the previous loop. The Echoplex assumes you want to elaborate on the B part.

Default: 36 Source # Parameter Row: MIDI 
Determines the starting note number, or controller number, for MIDI control of Echoplex operations. 
Values: 0-99 
The Source# parameter determines the base note or controller number from which all the other MIDI commands are referenced. All buttons and functions are assigned to notes or controllers based on this parameter value. The table below shows all the MIDI commands available and their offset from the Source# value.

SwitchQuant Default: Off Parameter Row: Loops 
Lets you quantize loop switches. Makes it possible to jump to specific loops, copy the current loop to another, or set up specific functions to begin in a new loop. 
Values: Off (OFF),  Confirm (CnF), Cycle (CYC), ConfirmCycle (CCY), Loop (LOP), ConfirmLoop (CLP) 
The SwitchQuant parameter applies when you are using multiple loops. (Multiple loops are set up in advance with the MoreLoops parameter.) SwitchQuant determines when the switch to the next loop will occur after the NextLoop button has been pressed. Loop switching can occur immediately (SwitchQuant = Off), after a confirming press of the Undo button (SwitchQuant = Confirm), at the end of the current cycle or loop (SwitchQuant = Cycle or Loop), or a combination of these (SwitchQuant = ConfirmCycle or ConfirmLoop). 
Quantizing loop switches is useful for maintaining a tight rhythm when you are working with multiple loops. 
SwitchQuant=Cycle, Loop, Confirm, ConfirmCycle, and ConfirmLoop are also very useful because they give you time to take additional actions before the move to the next loop takes effect. For the sake of this discussion, well call the time interval between the pressing of the NextLoop button and the end of the current loop the quantize period. 

SWITCHQUANTIZE OPTIONS 


OFF (SWITCHQUANT = OFF) 
When NextLoop is pressed the Echoplex immediately switches to the next loop with no quantizing. For example, if you are currently on loop 2, pressing NextLoop will instantly put you in loop 3. 

SwitchQuant

CONFIRM (SWITCHQUANT = CNF) 
When NextLoop is pressed the Echoplex goes into the quantize period but then waits indefinitely with the current loop playing until a confirming action is made. During this waiting period you may continue to press NextLoop to select different loops without actually switching to them. The display shows the loop you will switch to when the confirming action is made.  The simplest type of confirm action is to press the Undo button, which will send you immediately to the loop you have selected. You can also confirm the loop switch with Record, Overdub, Multiply, Insert, or Mute, which will switch you to the selected loop and immediately execute that respective function. 


CYCLE (SWITCHQUANT = CYC) 
When NextLoop is pressed, the Echoplex will wait until the next Cycle point to switch loops. During the quantize period you may select a different loop to switch to by pressing NextLoop additional times. You may also arm another function to execute in the new loop when the switch occurs. For example, if you press Record during the waiting period the Echoplex will wait until the current cycle of the current loop ends, switch to the next loop, and immediately begin recording. 


CONFIRMCYCLE (SWITCHQUANT = CCY) 
ConfirmCycle is a combination of the Confirm and Cycle values. When you press NextLoop, the Echoplex goes into an indefinite waiting period while the current loop plays, just like with Confirm. After a confirming action is done, the Echoplex additionally quantizes the loop switch to the next Cycle point as it does when SwitchQuant=Cycle. 


LOOP (SWITCHQUANT = LOP) 
When NextLoop is pressed, the Echoplex will wait until the next Loop point to switch loops. During the quantize period you may select a 
SwitchQuant

different loop to switch to by pressing NextLoop additional times. You may also arm another function to execute in the new loop when the switch occurs. This value is useful when you have used Multiply or Insert and wish to always quantize to the overall loop length. 


CONFIRMLOOP (SWITCHQUANT = CLP) 
Similar to ConfirmCycle.  After a confirming action is done, the Echoplex additionally quantizes the loop switch to the next loop StartPoint. 



Example 4.x: Using Confirm Cycle (CCY) 
1. Set SwitchQuant=CCY 
2. 
Set MoreLoops=2 and record two loops. 

3. 
Press NextLoop, it waits for you to do some action. 

4. 
Press the function you want (Record, Overdub, Multiply, Insert, etc...) 

5. 
The action will begin in the new loop after the next Cycle point of the current loop. 


DISPLAY DURING SWITCHQUANTIZING 
With SwitchQuant on, a press of the NextLoop button will turn the front-panel LEDs under the Record, Overdub, Multiply, Insert, Mute, and Undo buttons orange, while the LED under NextLoop will be red. The orange color indicates that all of these buttons take on interesting functions during the quantize period, as the explanations and examples on the following pages will illustrate. 
During the quantize period the LoopTime Display changes to show the destination loop. It will be displayed as L 1, L 2, etc. This is the

loop you will go to when the quantize period ends. If you continue pressing NextLoop during this time, you will see the destination increment. 

BUTTONS ACTIVE DURING THE QUANTIZE PERIOD 

NextLoop 
Pressing NextLoop during the quantize period increments the destination loop without switching you there. This skips over the next loop, allowing you to move to any other loop without activating the ones in-between. The current destination loop is displayed in the LoopTime display. 


Example 4.16: Switching to a Loop Other Than the Next One 
When SwitchQuant is on, you can move directly from any loop to any other, without passing through the intermediate loops. For instance, to switch from Loop 1 to Loop 3, take the following steps: 

1. Set MoreLoops to 3 or more 
2. Set SwitchQuant=Loop 
3. 
Record something a few seconds long into Loop 1, then end recording. 

4. 
Near the beginning of the loop, press NextLoop twice. Notice that the display shows L 3 in red, indicating that you are going to loop 3 next. 

5. 
When your loop ends, note that you will be switched immediately into Loop 3. If AutoRecord=On, then the Echoplex Digital Pro will start recording as soon as you enter that loop.
