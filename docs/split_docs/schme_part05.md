*Notes:* This JSON shows the two top-level categories **SystemHardwareLayer** and **SystemSoftwareLayer**, each containing components (subsystems). Each component has a name, a brief role description, and an **interacts_with** list to indicate which other parts it communicates with. For example, the BLK Interface interacts with ParameterLayer (for adjusting values), ControllerLayer (for sending loop control commands), etc. and the FeedbackLayer interacts with many others because feedback changes can be initiated by hardware (knob/pedal), affect the buffer’s audio, be governed by a parameter, and considered by the controller during state changes. This schema provides a blueprint of the architecture’s composition and relationships suitable for analysis or import into other tools.

## Rationale for Architectural Decisions

- **Why the BLK Layer resides in System Hardware:** The BLK (Buttons-LEDs-Knobs) interface is inherently tied to physical hardware – it directly reads electrical signals from buttons and potentiometers and drives LED circuits. Placing it within **System Hardware Layer** enforces a clean separation between hardware-dependent code and the rest of the system logic. This yields a classic Hardware Abstraction Benefit: the higher layers of software are insulated from hardware specifics. For example, if the physical control mechanism changes (say, a new model uses different buttons or an OLED screen instead of simple LEDs), only the BLK layer or Hardware layer would need updating. This design adheres to the dependency inversion principle, making the system more modular and maintainable by decoupling hardware interaction from application logic.
- **Why we split the original System Layer into Hardware and Software:** Splitting was driven by the principle of **separation of concerns**. In early design, having one “System” responsible for everything was leading to intertwined code (hardware handling mixed with loop logic). By dividing into System Hardware vs. System Software, each can focus on its domain. This makes the architecture easier to reason about, develop, and test – you can work on the software logic without constantly dealing with hardware interrupts, and vice versa. It also provides *layers of isolation*, meaning changes in one layer (say upgrading to a new microcontroller or altering how the buffer is managed) have minimal impact on the other. This modular approach improves reliability and agility: for instance, the team can simulate the entire System Software on a PC using the BLK interface as a mock, which speeds up development. In summary, the split creates a clearer responsibility boundary that enhances maintainability and scalability of the system.
- **How this structure supports loop state tracking, hardware feedback, and parameter configurability:** The layered design directly addresses these core needs:
  - *Loop State Tracking:* The **Controller Layer** serves as a dedicated state machine for loop operations, which means the various states (recording, playing, overdubbing, etc.) and transitions are explicitly handled in one place. This clarity prevents state-related bugs and allows complex behaviors (like multi-loop switching or quantized actions) to be implemented systematically. The architecture ensures the Controller has direct lines of communication to the Buffer (for timing/length) and to hardware via BLK for responding to user input, enabling tight control over loop state.
  - *Hardware Feedback:* Immediate feedback to the performer is achieved by the BLK Layer controlling LEDs and display elements in response to state changes. Because BLK is integrated in the Hardware layer, it can respond very quickly to events (e.g., lighting the Record LED the instant recording starts). The Controller signals such events to BLK (or BLK polls Controller status), and the user sees the result with minimal latency. For example, as soon as the system enters Record mode, the Record button’s light can flash red – the design of separate layers doesn’t impede this; in fact, it clarifies it by having a defined pathway for updates. The hardware feedback loop is thus robust: any state or parameter change that needs to be conveyed to the user goes through BLK’s well-defined interface (update LEDs, etc.), ensuring consistency.
  - *Parameter Configurability:* The presence of a dedicated Parameter Layer (with support from the Preset Layer) makes the system highly configurable. Users can enter Parameter Mode and tweak a multitude of settings without stopping the music, because the Parameter Layer applies changes on the fly. The BLK interface is context-aware to facilitate this, and the Parameter layer cleanly separates these concerns from the main loop logic. This means new parameters can be added without touching the core audio engine – you simply add it in the Parameter definitions and handle its effect where appropriate. Additionally, by having a Preset Layer, the device can store full sets of parameters, allowing complex setups to be recalled instantly. Overall, the architecture ensures that configuring the system is both **immediate** (thanks to real-time update design) and **enduring** (thanks to presets), all organized in a modular way that keeps the code manageable.

In conclusion, the restructured Echoplex architecture – with its clear division between hardware and software, and further breakdown into functional layers – provides a robust foundation for a loop pedal system. It maximizes clarity (each part has a well-defined role), modifiability (layers can change internally with minimal side-effects), and performance (critical real-time tasks are handled at the appropriate layer). This design directly benefits the user experience by ensuring reliable loop state management, instantaneous feedback, and flexible parameter control, all of which are essential in a live looping context. The collaborative iteration on this structure has yielded a system that is both **engineered for technical soundness** and **aligned with the musical workflow** of the Echoplex.



Perfect. I will generate full low-to-mid level pseudocode for the entire Echoplex unit based on the finalized layered structure you’ve outlined. This will include structural modeling, functional definitions, the full BLK and Feedback Layer logic, and JSON encoding where applicable.

Once it’s ready, you’ll have a complete snapshot of the architecture suitable for simulation, documentation, or integration into a Qdrant system.

# Echoplex System Architecture Pseudocode

## System Hardware Layer (Power, BLK: Buttons/LEDs/Knobs)

Handles the physical power state and the **BLK** user interface (Buttons, LEDs, Knobs). All input and output at this layer respect the current power state and the global Parameter Mode state.

### Buttons

- **Power Button:** Toggles system power on/off (initializes or shuts down hardware).
- **Other Buttons:** Read and debounced; generate events for the System Software layer. Logic differs based on Parameter Mode:

```pseudo
onButtonPress(button):
    if systemPower == OFF:
        if button == POWER_BUTTON:
            systemPower = ON
            initializeHardware()
        else:
            ignore()  # no effect when power is off
    else:  # systemPower is ON
        if button == POWER_BUTTON:
            systemPower = OFF
