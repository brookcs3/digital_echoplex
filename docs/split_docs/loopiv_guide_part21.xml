<P>ReplaceMode  (Loop/Delay = rPL, Pedal Only) </P>

<P>In ReplaceMode the pedal controls Loop Output Volume and Feedback simultaneously. The result is similar to LoopMode, except that you hear the reduction for feedback immediately instead of on the next loop pass. This makes it easier to &quot;sculpt&quot; the loop using the feedback control. If you have Overdub on, the pedal serves as a Replace function with smooth level control. So you can add new material and smoothly drop out the loop underneath you as it is overdubbed, allowing for a smooth real-time replace. The disadvantage of ReplaceMode is that if the pedal is in the toe-up position, the loop output is also zero, so it is not possible to create loops with only single repetitions.  It is also less interesting for any loops relying on reduced feedback settings, since the output is affected. This InterfaceMode does not exist without a Pedal connected. </P>
