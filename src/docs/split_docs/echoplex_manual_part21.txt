MuteMode determines where loop playback starts the second time you press the Mutebutton. As youll see under "Alternate Endings" below, whichever approach you choose, the Undobutton takes the opposite viewpoint, so youll always have both ways to end a Mute readily available. 

MuteMode=Start 
When MuteMode=Start, a second press of the Mute button will always restart the current loop at the beginning. This is probably the most useful setting for solo playing. 
When MuteMode=Start, the end of the Mute is affected by the setting of Quantize. If Quantize=On, then sound wont restart until the end of the current cycle. 
Be aware that restarting the loop can move your StartPoint in relation to external sequencers or other musicians. This could be a problem if you wish to keep things tight with a sequencer, but it can also be very useful if the bands time has shifted and you need to line your loop up again with everybody else.

MuteMode=Continuous 
When the MuteMode=Continuous, the loop continues counting even when it is silenced by pressing Mute. Then, when you press Mute a second time to allow audio output again, the loop will become audible wherever it happens to be at that time. This is probably most useful if you want to silence the loop for just a beat or two to play a fill, or have your loop stay in time with other musicians even while it is not heard. 

ALTERNATE ENDINGS 
You can also end Mute with a number of other buttons, as follows: 

UNDO 
Acts like the second press of the Mute button, except that it uses the opposite value of MuteMode. In other words, if MuteMode=Start, then the Undo ending behaves like the Mute button would if MuteMode were Continuous. Similarly, if MuteMode=Continuous, then the Undo ending behaves like the Mute button would if MuteMode were Start. 


INSERT 
Plays the loop once and then goes back into Mute state. If you press it again it will retrigger. Useful for stuttering effects. 
This ending is affected by Quantize. If Quantize=On, the loop will be played once, starting at the end of the current cycle. 


MULTIPLY 
Executes ReAlign, which allows you to get lined up with external devices that have been stopped and restarted. See ReAlign for more info.

THE LONG PRESS 
When you press and hold the Mute button, the loop output will be silenced until you release the button, at which time it will continue playing. During this operation, the loop will continue running even when silenced, regardless of the setting of MuteModereleasing the button will not start the loop at the beginning, except by coincidence.

Immediate Action NextLoop Play Mode 
Moves to the next loop. 
NextLoop is primarily used when multiple loops are set up with the MoreLoops parameter. Pressing NextLoop will switch you to the next loop. 
The setting of SwitchQuant will affect when this happenssee the discussion of SwitchQuant for a detailed explanation. 

RECORD -TO - NEXTLOOP 
If you have the MoreLoops parameter set greater than one, ending a recording with NextLoop immediately ends the recording and puts you immediately into the next loop. 
If AutoRecord=On, the Echoplex immediately continues recording in the new loop. You can continue playing without any interruption, and have what you play split into the two loops. This is especially useful for filling the loops with the various parts of a song while playing continuously. You just keep pressing Next as you play! This is a great way to record a verse loop and chorus loop in one pass, as you play them live. If you continue to press NextLoop at the end of each part, you can use this method to record into all of the loops you have set up. 
Similarly, if LoopCopy=Sound or LoopCopy=Time, you can continuously copy the audio or the time base into new loops as you record them in one pass. 
When MoreLoops=1, ending Record by pressing NextLoop stops recording and begins playing the loop, just as if the recording had been ended with another press of Record. Note however, that when MoreLoops = 1, NextLoop becomes a retrigger button, so Record-to-NextLoop can be an interesting way to immediately go into stutters of your loop.

Immediate Action Overdub Play Mode 
Lets you add layers of sound. 
Overdub is the basic magic wand of the Echoplex Digital Pro. It allows you to add layer after layer of sound to any existing loop. As you play, the level of the sound in the existing loop is subtly lowered to prevent a gradual accumulation of signal that would overload the system. You can leave Overdub on for extended periods of time, but we recommend that you turn it off if you arent adding new sonic material to the mix. 
See the Quick Start, page 1-1, for the fastest introduction to overdubbing. 
Overdub is related to the Insert and Multiply functions, but its behavior is simpler. Unlike those operations, Overdub never changes the length of the cycle or loop. Overdub is also not affected by the settings of Quantize or RoundModeoverdubbing starts when you press down the Overdub button, and ends either when you press it a second time or when you release it (see "The Long Press" below). Overdub is, however, affected by the setting of OverdubMode (also discussed under "The Long Press" below). 

BASIC OVERDUBBING 
The Overdub function is started by pressing the Overdub button. The existing cycle is mixed with the new playing. Every time the cycle reaches its start point, youll be adding another layer over that which youve just recorded. Figure 4.10 demonstrates this behavior.

ALTERNATE ENDINGS 
The only way to end an overdub operation is to press the Overdub button a second time. Youll get the results illustrated in the example above. However, you can execute other functions while Overdubbing by pressing any of the buttons whose front-panel lights are on during the Overdub. The function will execute as normal, and when you end it Overdub will still be on. 

THE LONG PRESS 
Pressing and holding down the Overdub button for longer than half a second has the same effect as a pair of short press-and-releases. In other words, overdubbing will start when you press and hold the button and end when you release it. 

Overdub 
Continued 
Overdub can be held on in a sustain fashion with a long press while simultaneously pressing other buttons to execute other functions. This is true whether Overdub is activated from the front panel buttons, from the foot pedal, or with a momentary switch in the Overdub Jack. 
For example, you can keep Overdub long-pressed and then press Reverse simultaneously to go in and out of Reverse while Overdubbing. 
Simultaneous Overdub is useful when using Overdub as a SUS function. Note this only works with the Overdub button, and no other functions. Also, it does not work to do long-press functions on other buttons while holding Overdub. They will be treated as short-presses. 

THE  EFFECT  OF  OVERDUB MODE  
When OverdubMode is set to Toggle, the Overdub button works as  
described above. However, when OverdubMode is set to Sustain, you can  
only layer sounds while you hold down the buttonas soon as you  
release it, the overdubbing stops. This is similar to using the long  
presses of the Overdub button, except it is guaranteed to always  
operate in Sustain fashion no matter how short or long you press it.  
There are many situations when youre likely to want to set  
OverdubMode to Sustain, for example:  
n  You want to overdub extremely short excerpts from a sound source. If  
OverdubMode=Toggle you have to press Overdub twice, which can be  
difficult to do quickly. With OverdubMode=Sustain you can capture very  
short fragments of sound into your loop.  
n  You want to guard against inadvertently putting yourself into an  
extended Overdub, so you decide to overdub only when your foot is  
holding down the button.This is extremely useful if you are playing  
without looking at the Echoplex. You will always know the state of  
Overdub by whether you are pressing it or not.
