<P>DelayMode (Loop/Delay = DEL) </P>

<P>DelayMode operation is like a traditional delay, and is useful for people familiar with that style of looping. In a traditional delay, the input to the delay line is always open and feedback is always being applied. When a “Hold” button is pressed, the input to the delay is closed, and the feedback is set to 100%. So in DelayMode during normal playing, the Loop Input level is always open and feedback is controlled by the front panel knob. The Overdub button becomes the “hold” button, so when you press it the feedback is set to 100% for infinite repeats and the input is closed so that nothing new is added to the loop. This is different from the LoopMode style, where feedback is always available to control whether overdubbing or not. </P>

<P>In DelayMode, the foot pedal controls the Loop Input level, which is useful as a way to do volume swells into the delay line. </P>

<P id="LinkTarget_519">One improvement has been made to DelayMode from LoopIII. The “Hold” function accessed by pressing Overdub also works while Multiplying and while the loop is Muted, which is more consistent. </P>
