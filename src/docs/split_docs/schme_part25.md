| 6           | root reducer + init        | Combines slices, seeds state                      |
| 7‑8         | `middlewares/*`            | Example side‑effect layers (audio, MIDI)          |
| 9           | —                          | Tiny queue so reducers can emit follow‑up actions |
| 10          | —                          | Bootstraps store, demo dispatches                 |

You now have a **linear, copy‑pasteable hierarchy** that exactly mirrors the multi‑file architecture while remaining a single script.
 Replace the stubbed controller / buffer / feedback reducers with your detailed logic, wire real hardware I/O inside the middlewares, and the parameter matrix will already work out of the box.
