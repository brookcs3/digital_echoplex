  mode: 'solid'
}
// For each knob:
feedback: {
  position: 0.75,         // Value from min to max
  min: 0.0,
  max: 1.0
}
```

**All BLK items are “gated” by power:**
 If `sysHW.power === false`, then:

- All `.pressed` = false
- All `.led` and `.state` = 'off'
- All knob actions are ignored

------

## 🧠 **Summary**

- **sysHW**: Physical controls, *real* button/LED/knob state
  - **blk**: Buttons, LEDs, Knobs (with sections for each)
- **sysSW**: Global logic, modes, interprets hardware events
- **parameters, preset, signal, controls, buffer, feedbackUI**: Downstream layers for full system behavior

------

Want a **full reducer function** that takes button/knob events and applies them through this structure? Or a mapping of how BLK events get interpreted in both hardware and software layers?

I’ll let you know when the full document is ready for your review.

# Echoplex Control System Architecture Restructuring Report

## Chronological Summary of Iterative Design Decisions

1. **Initial Architecture & Goals:** The session began with an outline of the Echoplex looper’s control system. Initially, the architecture was somewhat monolithic, blending hardware control with software logic. The goal was to manage loop recording/playback, parameter editing, and feedback control, but the responsibilities of components were not clearly separated.
2. **Identifying Layered Components:** Early in the discussion, we identified key functional groupings – such as hardware interface, core loop logic, parameter management, presets, audio signal processing, and feedback control. The idea of organizing these into distinct **layers** emerged to clarify roles and reduce coupling, reflecting best practices for layered design (each layer handling a specific concern). This would make the system easier to develop and maintain as independent units rather than one large system.
3. **Splitting System Hardware vs Software:** A pivotal decision was to split the original “System” layer into **System Hardware** and **System Software** layers. This separation created a hardware abstraction boundary: all physical device handling would reside in System Hardware, decoupling it from the high-level logic in System Software. This aligns with the principle of hardware abstraction, which **decouples application code from underlying hardware**, allowing changes in hardware or simulation of hardware without altering core logic. By doing so, each side could be modified or tested in isolation.
4. **Introducing the BLK Interface Layer:** We collaboratively introduced the **BLK Layer** (Buttons, LEDs, Knobs) as a sub-layer within System Hardware to manage the front-panel controls and indicators. Initially, these controls were handled directly by system logic, but we decided to encapsulate them in BLK for clarity. The BLK layer would scan button input states, update LED indicators, and read knob changes, acting as the dedicated interface between the hardware and the rest of the system. This change ensured immediate hardware feedback (LEDs reacting to state changes) and consistent control handling in one place.
5. **Parameter Mode & Contextual Control:** As the conversation progressed, we focused on how the system enters a **Parameter Mode** (for editing configuration parameters) versus normal **Play Mode** (looping operations). We decided that the BLK layer should be context-aware: in Parameter Mode, buttons and knobs manipulate parameter settings, whereas in Play Mode they trigger loop functions. This required iterative refinement of the BLK design – ultimately, we defined that a press of the *Parameter* button toggles modes, and in parameter-editing state the BLK would route inputs to the Parameter Layer (adjusting values and giving visual feedback via LEDs or display). This context-sensitive control was refined through pseudocode (see **BLK Layer** section below) to ensure robust mode switching and user feedback.
6. **Defining Parameter vs Preset Layers:** The architecture was further refined by distinguishing the **Parameter Layer** (which holds runtime parameters and handles changes) from a **Preset Layer** (which stores and recalls sets of parameters). Earlier, parameters and presets were conflated, but the discussion led to separating them: the Parameter Layer would manage current values (e.g. current *Feedback* level, *MoreLoops* count, etc.), while the Preset Layer would save/load these values as presets. This separation allows real-time parameter tweaks without immediately overwriting saved presets, and enables storing configurations that persist across power cycles.
7. **Refining Signal Chain, Buffer, and Feedback Layers:** We recognized that audio processing involves distinct concerns: the **Signal Chain Layer** to handle input/output mix and routing, the **Buffer Layer** to manage recorded audio memory, and a **Feedback Layer** to govern how loops decay or sustain. Initially, these might have been lumped together, but through iteration we teased them apart:
   - The Signal Chain layer would contain the audio path configuration (input->loop->output) and mix levels.
   - The Buffer layer would handle memory for recording and playback of loops (including managing multiple loops if supported).
   - The Feedback layer specifically would control the loop feedback coefficient (how much of the previous loop is fed into the next repetition), since feedback is crucial to looping behavior.
      This modular breakdown means, for example, the feedback control can be adjusted independently without affecting how the buffer stores audio, aligning with the isolation benefits of layered design.
8. **Finalizing the Hierarchy & JSON Schema:** In the final stage, we solidified the hierarchy of layers and their relationships. We prepared a structured JSON schema representing the components and their nesting (for potential ingestion into a vector database like Qdrant). We also documented pseudocode for critical parts (notably the BLK hardware interface logic) and a rationale for the architectural choices. The resulting design is a comprehensive multi-layer control system that cleanly separates hardware from software and organizes functionality into logical layers for maintainability and clarity.

## Echoplex Architecture: Full Structural Breakdown

Below is the breakdown of the proposed Echoplex control system architecture, with each layer’s role defined and the relationships between layers clarified.

### System Hardware Layer

The **System Hardware Layer** encapsulates all physical hardware components and their direct control. It is responsible for interfacing with tangible elements of the Echoplex device, ensuring that the System Software layer doesn’t need to manage low-level hardware details. Key aspects of this layer include:

- **Physical Controls & Indicators:** Management of buttons, LEDs, knobs, foot pedals, displays, and any sensors. For example, the Echoplex front panel has eight multi-function buttons, multiple indicator LEDs, and knobs for levels – reading these inputs and driving these outputs is handled here.
- **Hardware Abstraction:** This layer acts as a **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** for the system. It provides a standardized interface (APIs or data structures) to the System Software so that higher-level logic can query button states or set LED statuses without knowing hardware specifics (e.g., GPIO pins or electrical details). This abstraction enables easier hardware changes or simulation down the line.
- **Subcomponents:** System Hardware contains the BLK Interface sub-layer (detailed next) and potentially other hardware-specific modules (e.g., Audio I/O interfaces or footswitch controllers). All such subcomponents directly manipulate or monitor hardware devices.

#### BLK Layer (Button-LED-Knob Interface)

This **BLK Layer** is nested within System Hardware and is dedicated to managing the **Buttons, LEDs, and Knobs** on the Echoplex’s control panel. It serves as the bridge between user interactions (button presses, knob turns) and the system’s logic, as well as the conveyor of feedback via LEDs or display. Below is pseudocode illustrating BLK Layer behavior with explanations:

```pseudo
# Pseudocode for BLK Layer - manages Buttons, LEDs, Knobs
state parameterMode = false
currentParameter = None

loop forever:
    # 1. Read all physical inputs (buttons and knobs)
    buttonStates = read_all_buttons()       # e.g., array or dict of button -> pressed/released
    knobPositions = read_all_knobs()       # e.g., current analog values or increments

    # 2. Check for mode toggle (Parameter button)
    if buttonStates["Parameter"] == PRESSED:
        parameterMode = not parameterMode   # toggle Parameter Mode on/off
        update_mode_indicator(parameterMode)  # update LED or display to show mode change

    # 3. Handle button inputs based on current mode
    if parameterMode:
        # Parameter Mode behavior: buttons select or adjust parameters
        for btn, pressed in buttonStates:
            if pressed and btn != "Parameter":
                currentParameter = map_button_to_param(btn)  # select parameter based on which button
                show_active_parameter(currentParameter)      # light an LED row or display to indicate selected param

        # Knob adjustments affect parameter values in real-time
        if currentParameter is not None:
