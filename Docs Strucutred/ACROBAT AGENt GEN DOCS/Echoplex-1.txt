The Echoplex Digital Pro Plus is a sophisticated audio looping device with extensive features and functionalities. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of its capabilities, categorized for clarity:
### 1. Technical Specifications
**Input/Output Configurations**
* **Audio Input:** High-impedance 1/4" jack for microphones, guitars, or line-level signals.
* **Audio Output:** Line-level signal controlled by the Output knob or MIDI Control Change messages.
* **MIDI Ports:** Standard MIDI In, Out, and Thru for synchronization and control.
* **Footswitch Jacks:** Dedicated jacks for Feedback, Overdub, and Record functions.

⠀**Control Parameters**
* **Knobs:** Input, Output, Mix, and Feedback knobs for level adjustments.
* **Buttons:** Record, Overdub, Multiply, Insert/Reverse, Mute, Undo, NextLoop, and Parameter buttons.
* **Parameter Matrix:** Four rows of parameters (Timing, Switches, MIDI, Loops) accessible via the Parameter button.

⠀**Value Ranges and Units**
* **Feedback:** 0-127 (percentage of signal fed back into the loop).
* **Input/Output Levels:** Adjustable via knobs and MIDI controllers.
* **Quantize Modes:** Off, Cycle, Loop, 8th subdivisions.
* **Eighths per Cycle:** 1-96, 128, 256 subdivisions for synchronization.

⠀**Signal Routing and Processing Chain**
* Audio signal flows through Input, Feedback, and Output stages, with real-time adjustments possible via knobs and MIDI controllers.

⠀**Presets and Memory Locations**
* Up to 16 loops can be stored, labeled numerically (1-9) and alphabetically (A-G).
* Memory persists across power cycles, with factory reset available.

⠀**MIDI Implementation**
* MIDI NoteOn/Continuous Control messages for button emulation.
* MIDI clocks for synchronization with external devices.
* MIDI SysEx for parameter editing and preset management.

⠀2. User Interface
**Layout and Positioning**
* **Front Panel:** Includes knobs, buttons, multicolored indicator lights, and a 6-character display.
* **Back Panel:** Contains audio jacks, MIDI ports, footswitch jacks, and power input.

⠀**Visual Feedback Elements**
* **Indicator Lights:** Multicolored lights for Input, Feedback, and button status.
* **Display:** Shows loop time, cycle count, and parameter values.

⠀**Control Behaviors**
* **Knobs:** Linear adjustments for levels.
* **Buttons:** Short press for immediate actions; long press for alternate functions.
* **Parameter Editing:** Accessed via the Parameter button and corresponding row indicator lights.

⠀**Interaction Patterns**
* **Button Combinations:** Mute-Multiply for ReAlign functions.
* **Double-Click:** SmartButton presses for advanced operations like copying and recording.

⠀3. Audio Processing Details
**DSP Algorithms and Processing Stages**
* Real-time granular looping with SUS commands.
* Functions like Reverse, HalfSpeed, Substitute, and Multiply for creative audio manipulation.

⠀**Parameter Interdependencies**
* Feedback adjustments affect loop persistence.
* Quantize settings influence synchronization precision.

⠀**Real-Time vs Non-Real-Time Operations**
* Real-time: Recording, overdubbing, multiplying, reversing.
* Non-real-time: Parameter editing, preset management.

⠀**Latency Specifications**
* Minimal latency due to high-fidelity digital processing.

⠀4. Implementation Notes
**Web Audio API Nodes**
* Required nodes: GainNode (for Feedback), AudioBufferSourceNode (for loops), and ScriptProcessorNode (for real-time DSP).

⠀**UI Component Specifications**
* Replicate front panel layout with interactive knobs, buttons, and displays.
* Include visual feedback for button presses and parameter changes.

⠀**State Management Requirements**
* Maintain loop states (recording, overdubbing, multiplying, etc. ).
* Synchronize MIDI clocks and external devices.

⠀**Performance Considerations**
* Optimize for low-latency audio processing.
* Ensure smooth transitions between loop states and parameter changes.

⠀This breakdown provides a detailed overview of the Echoplex Digital Pro Plus, ensuring that all features and functionalities are accounted for in the web-based emulation.
