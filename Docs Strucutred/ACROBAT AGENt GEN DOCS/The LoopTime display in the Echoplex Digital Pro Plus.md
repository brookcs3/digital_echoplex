# The LoopTime display in the Echoplex Digital Pro Plus 
is a critical component for providing real-time feedback to the user during various operations. Below is a detailed implementation plan for replicating the LoopTime display and its alternate modes in a web-based emulation:
### 1. Core Functionality of the LoopTime Display
The LoopTime display serves multiple purposes depending on the operational context:
* **Loop Length:** Displays the length of the current loop during playback.
* **Recording Progress:** Tracks the time recorded during Record, Multiply, or Insert operations.
* **Feedback Changes:** Shows feedback values (0-127) when adjusted via knobs, foot pedals, or MIDI.
* **Command Names:** Briefly displays command names for operations without dedicated LEDs (e.g., "rE" for Reverse, "H.SP" for HalfSpeed).
* **Sync Time:** Displays cycle time after synchronization with MIDI clocks or external sync pulses.
* **Memory Size:** Shows available memory during startup or after a GeneralReset.

⠀2. Alternate Modes of the LoopTime Display
**Play Mode**
* Displays the loop length and flashes indicators for:
  * **Loop StartPoint:** Indicates the beginning of the loop.
  * **Cycle StartPoint:** Indicates the start of cycles within the loop.
  * **Sub-Cycle (8th Note):** Flashes based on the 8ths/Cycle parameter.
  * **Global MIDI StartPoint:** Indicates alignment with external MIDI clocks.

⠀**Parameter Editing Mode**
* Displays the current parameter value being edited.
* Updates dynamically as the user adjusts values using buttons or knobs.

⠀**Sync Mode**
* Displays the expected loop time based on incoming MIDI clock signals.
* Shows "ooo" when waiting for quantized actions to execute.

⠀**Feedback and Continuous Controller Display**
* Displays feedback changes as a red number (0-127) in place of the loop time.
* Updates dynamically when feedback is adjusted via knobs, pedals, or MIDI.

⠀**Command Display**
* Briefly shows command names for operations without dedicated LEDs:
  * **rE:** Reverse
  * **H.SP:** HalfSpeed
  * **F.SP:** FullSpeed
  * **LOA:** Load Preset
  * **SAF:** Save Preset
  * **RES:** Revert Preset to default

⠀3. Implementation Plan
**UI Component**
* Use a <div> or <canvas> element to replicate the LoopTime display.
* Design the display to accommodate dynamic updates, including numbers, letters, and flashing indicators.

⠀**State Management**
* Maintain a state object to track the current mode (e.g., Play Mode, Parameter Editing Mode).
* Update the display dynamically based on the active mode and user actions.

⠀**Event Handling**
* Attach event listeners to buttons and knobs to trigger updates to the display.
* Use timers (setTimeout) to clear temporary messages (e.g., command names) after a few seconds.

⠀**Synchronization**
* Use Web Audio API's AudioContext.currentTime to synchronize flashing indicators with loop timing.
* Integrate MIDI clock signals to update Sync Time and alignment indicators.

⠀**Dynamic Updates**
* Implement logic to switch between modes based on user actions:
  * **Play Mode:** Update loop length and flash indicators.
  * **Parameter Editing Mode:** Display parameter values and update dynamically.
  * **Sync Mode:** Show expected loop time and quantization status.

⠀4. Performance Considerations
* Optimize display updates for low-latency response.
* Use efficient rendering techniques (e.g., batching updates) to minimize CPU usage.
* Ensure smooth transitions between modes and states.

⠀5. Visual Feedback Integration
* Synchronize flashing indicators with loop timing and MIDI clocks.
* Use CSS animations or JavaScript timers for smooth visual effects.

⠀This implementation plan ensures the LoopTime display and its alternate modes are faithfully replicated in the web-based emulation, providing users with intuitive and real-time feedback.
### Next Steps
1 I can outline the MIDI integration for synchronization and parameter control.
2 I can detail the implementation of flashing indicators for visual tempo and sync guides.
