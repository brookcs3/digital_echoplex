## To best emulate the button interface of the Echoplex Digital Pro Plus hardware unit, 
The programming should replicate the physical and functional behaviors of the buttons, including their interaction patterns, visual feedback, and parameter control. Below is a high-level description of how the button interface should be programmed:
### 1. Button Functionality
**Primary Functions**
Each button corresponds to a specific operation:
* **Record:** Starts/stops recording loops.
* **Overdub:** Adds layers to the current loop.
* **Multiply:** Extends the loop by repeating cycles.
* **Insert/Reverse:** Inserts audio or reverses playback.
* **Mute:** Silences the loop.
* **Undo:** Reverts the last action.
* **NextLoop:** Switches between loops.
* **Parameter:** Enters parameter editing mode.

⠀**Secondary Functions**
Buttons can perform alternate functions based on context:
* **Long Press:** Activates advanced operations (e.g., resetting loops, toggling modes).
* **Double-Click:** Executes quick actions like copying loops or stopping recording.

⠀**Interaction Patterns**
* **Short Press:** Executes the primary function.
* **Long Press:** Activates alternate functions (e.g., reset, undo).
* **Sustain Mode:** For buttons like Record and Overdub, holding the button sustains the action until released.

⠀2. Visual Feedback
**Status Indicator Lights**
* **Green:** Button is ready for its primary function.
* **Red:** Indicates the button is actively performing its function.
* **Orange:** Button is available for alternate functions.

⠀**Display Integration**
* The display shows feedback for button actions, such as:
  * Loop time during recording.
  * Parameter values during editing.
  * Commands like "Reverse" (rE) or "HalfSpeed" (H.SP).

⠀3. Parameter Control
**Parameter Matrix**
* Buttons interact with a 4x8 grid of parameters, controlled by the Parameter button.
* Rows include Timing, Switches, MIDI, and Loops.
* Pressing the Parameter button cycles through rows, while other buttons adjust values within the selected row.

⠀**Dynamic Adjustments**
* Buttons like Record, Overdub, and Multiply increment values when pressed repeatedly.
* Long presses accelerate value changes.

⠀4. Programming Requirements
**Event Handling**
* Implement mousedown, mouseup, and mouseleave events for short and long presses.
* Support touch events (touchstart, touchend) for mobile compatibility.

⠀**State Management**
* Maintain button states (e.g., active, idle) and synchronize with visual feedback.
* Track loop states, parameter modes, and active functions.

⠀**Timing and Quantization**
* Ensure button actions align with loop timing and quantization settings.
* Use timers to detect long presses (e.g., 500ms threshold).

⠀**MIDI Integration**
* Buttons should send MIDI NoteOn/Continuous Control messages for external synchronization.
* Support MIDI SysEx commands for advanced parameter editing.

⠀5. Performance Considerations
* Optimize for low-latency response to button presses.
* Ensure smooth transitions between states (e.g., recording to overdubbing).
* Provide robust error handling for missing elements or invalid states.

⠀This design ensures the web-based interface faithfully replicates the physical and functional experience of the Echoplex hardware unit.
