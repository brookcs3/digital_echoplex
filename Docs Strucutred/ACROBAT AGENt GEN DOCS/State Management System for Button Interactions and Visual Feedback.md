# State Management System for Button Interactions and Visual Feedback
The Echoplex Digital Pro Plus hardware unit employs a sophisticated state management system to handle button interactions and visual feedback. Below is a detailed breakdown of how this system can be implemented in a web-based emulation:
### 1. Button Interaction State Management
**Button Press Types**
* **Short Press:** Executes primary functions (e.g., Record, Overdub).
* **Long Press:** Activates alternate functions (e.g., Reset, Undo).
* **Sustain Mode:** Allows holding buttons like Record or Overdub for continuous operation.
* **Double-Click:** Executes advanced operations like copying loops or stopping recording.

⠀**Implementation:**
* Use event listeners (mousedown, mouseup, mouseleave) to detect short and long presses.
* Implement a timer (setTimeout) to differentiate between short and long presses (e.g., 500ms threshold).
* Use dblclick events for double-click actions.
* Sustain mode requires continuous monitoring of button states while pressed.

⠀**Simultaneous Button Presses**
* Buttons like Overdub can be held while pressing others (e.g., Reverse) for simultaneous operations.
* Long presses on other buttons while holding Overdub are treated as short presses.

⠀**Implementation:**
* Track active buttons using a state object (e.g., this.state.activeButtons).
* Allow simultaneous button actions by checking button states before executing functions.

⠀**Parameter Editing Mode**
* Buttons take on alternate functions when the Parameter button is pressed.
* Row Indicator Lights illuminate to show the active parameter row.

⠀**Implementation:**
* Use a state variable (e.g., this.state.parameterMode) to toggle between Play Mode and Parameter Editing Mode.
* Update button functions dynamically based on the active parameter row.

⠀2. Visual Feedback State Management
**Status Indicator Lights**
* **Unlit:** Function unavailable.
* **Green:** Button ready for primary function.
* **Red:** Button actively performing its function.
* **Orange:** Button available for alternate functions.

⠀**Implementation:**
* Use CSS classes (.led-green, .led-red, .led-orange) to dynamically update LED colors based on button states.
* Attach state changes to button events (e.g., mousedown, mouseup).

⠀**Visual Tempo Guide LEDs**
* **Timing LED:** Blinks at sub-cycle points (e.g., 8th notes).
* **Switches LED:** Blinks at cycle start points.
* **MIDI LED:** Blinks at loop start points.
* **Multiple Right Dot:** Indicates global MIDI start point.
* **Multiple Left Dot:** Indicates sync corrections.

⠀**Implementation:**
* Use JavaScript timers (setInterval) to control LED blinking based on loop timing and synchronization parameters.
* Synchronize LED states with Web Audio API's AudioContext.currentTime for precise timing.

⠀**LoopTime Display**
* Displays loop length, feedback changes, and command names (e.g., "rE" for Reverse, "H.SP" for HalfSpeed).

⠀**Implementation:**
* Use a <div> or <canvas> element for the display.
* Update the display dynamically using JavaScript based on button actions and parameter changes.
* Implement a timeout (setTimeout) to clear temporary messages after a few seconds.

⠀3. State Management Requirements
**Button States**
* Maintain button states (e.g., active, idle) in a state object (e.g., this.state.buttons).
* Track loop states, parameter modes, and active functions.

⠀**Visual Feedback States**
* Use a state object (e.g., this.state.visualFeedback) to track LED and display states.
* Update states dynamically based on button interactions and audio processing.

⠀**Synchronization**
* Ensure button actions align with loop timing and quantization settings.
* Use Web Audio API nodes (e.g., GainNode, AudioBufferSourceNode) to synchronize audio and visual feedback.

⠀4. Performance Considerations
* Optimize event handling and timers for low-latency response.
* Ensure smooth transitions between states (e.g., recording to overdubbing).
* Minimize CPU usage by batching state updates.

⠀This state management system ensures the web-based emulation faithfully replicates the button interactions and visual feedback mechanisms of the Echoplex hardware unit.
