*If you* *Overdub* *while a reversed loop is playing and then press the*

*Reverse* *button a second time, youâ€™ll hear your original loop play back*

*forwards and your overdubbed part play backwards. You can easily have*

*audio going forwards and backwards in loop by combining* *Reverse* *and*

*Overdub.* *This is great for backwards guitar solos or secret messages.*

*Reverse and Overdub are independent, so you can Reverse the loop*

*while Overdubbing, and the Overdub will continue.*

*R**ECORD*

*Reverse* *can be used to end* *Record**, so that the* *Record* *stops and the loop*

*immediately plays backwards. This is very useful for doing backwards*

*audio tricks live. You may find this works especially well with the*

*Feedback Knob* *set to* *0* *and the* *Mix Knob* *set to* *Loop**only works with the* *Reverse* *button (**InsertMode=Reverse**) or the*

*Reverse VirtualButton**. the* *DirectMIDI Reverse* *has no effect while*

*Recording**.*

*M**ULTIPLY AND* *I**NSERT*

*Loops that have had cycles added to them using* *Multiply* *or* *Insert* *can*

*be* *Reversed**. You will notice the green* *Multiple Display* *counts the*

*cycles backwards while the loop is* *Reversed**. You can also engage*

*Multiply* *and* *Insert* *while the loop is* *Reversed**, and they work*

*normally.*

*The* *Multiply* *and* *Insert* *functions can be ended with a press of* *Reverse**.*

*The* *Multiply* *(or* *Insert**) will round off exactly like it normally would.*

*When it reaches the end of the cycle, the whole loop will immediately*

*play backwards. In this way you can go directly from* *Multiply* *into*

*Reverse* *without extra button presses.*
