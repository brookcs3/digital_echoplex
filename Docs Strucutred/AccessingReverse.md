*There are several different ways to access the* *Reverse* *function.*

*There is no direct* *Reverse* *button on the front panel, however you can*

*bring this function to the front panel and down to the footpedal by*

*setting* *InsertMode=Reverse.* *The* *Insert* *button then becomes the*

*Reverse* *button, and* *Reverse* *will take the place of the* *Insert* *function.*

*If you only need to access* *Reverse* *occasionally and want the* *Insert*

*button available for a different function, there is an indirect method*

*from the front panel to control* *Reverse.* *In the* *Parameter Matrix* *there*

*is a space labeled* *Reverse**, in the* *Timing Row* *under the* *Undo*

*button. At any time if you want to access* *Reverse,* *press* *Parameter*

*once, and then press* *Undo**.*

*Reverse is also available by MIDI. There are several different flavors of*

*MIDI Reverse:*

*n* *The MIDI VirtualButton* *ReverseButton* *is* *Source# + 13**. This behaves*

*exactly like the front panel buttons do, in this case as if there were a*

*front panel* *Reverse* *button.The NoteOn message presses the button,*

*and the NoteOff message releases the button. If you do a short-press tap*

*Reverse*

*of the* *ReverseButton,* *you go into* *Reverse,* *and then into* *Forward*

*when you tap it again. If you do a long-press of the* *ReverseButton**, it*

*will become SUS action and stay in* *Reverse* *as long as you hold the*

*button, and then go back to* *Forward* *when you release it.*
