The front panel of the Echoplex Digital Pro Plus is designed to provide intuitive control and feedback for its various functions.  Here's a detailed summary of how it works:

### **Front Panel Overview** 

The front panel includes:

1. 

2. **Power Switch**: Located on the right side to turn the unit on/off.

3. 

4. **Knobs**: Four knobs control input level, output level, mix between input and loop, and feedback level. 

5. 

6. Level Indicator Lights

   : Two multicolored lights monitor audio levels:

   - 
   - **Input Indicator**: Displays the level of the incoming signal. 
   - 
   - **Feedback Indicator**: Displays the volume of the material in the loop. 
   - 

   

7. 

8. **Display**: A 6-character display shows timing, loop length, and other information depending on the context. 

9. 

10. **Buttons**: Eight multi-function buttons control operations and settings. 

11. 

12. **Row Indicator Lights**: Four LEDs indicate which row of parameters is selected for editing. 

13. 

14. **Status Indicator Lights**: Lights under each button indicate the current state of the function. 

15. 

### **How the Buttons Work** 

The eight buttons on the front panel are used for both performing operations and editing parameters.  Their functions change depending on the mode:

1. 
2. **Play Mode**: When none of the Row Indicator Lights are lit, the buttons perform their primary functions (e.g., Record, Overdub, Multiply, etc. ).
3. 
4. **Parameter Editing Mode**: Pressing the **Parameter Button** cycles through the four rows of the Parameter Matrix (Timing, Switches, MIDI, Loops). The corresponding Row Indicator Light illuminates, and the buttons take on the meanings written in that row of the grid. 
5. 

### **Visual Feedback**

The front panel provides visual feedback through its lights and display:

1. 

2. Status Indicator Lights

   :

   - 
   - **Unlit**: Function unavailable. 
   - 
   - **Green**: Button is ready to perform its usual function. 
   - 
   - **Red**: Function is active or the button is currently being edited.
   - 
   - **Orange**: Button is available for a secondary function. 
   - 

   

3. 

4. Row Indicator Lights

   :

   - 
   - Indicate which row of the Parameter Matrix is selected during editing. 
   - 

   

5. 

6. LoopTime Display

   :

   - 
   - Shows the length of the current loop, feedback level, or other information depending on the operation. 
   - 
   - Displays special messages for commands (e.g., "rE" for Reverse, "St.S" for StartSong). 
   - 

   

7. 

8. Multiple Display

   :

   - 
   - Shows the current cycle number during Multiply or Insert operations. 
   - 
   - Displays the selected row in Parameter Editing Mode (e.g., "P1" for Timing Row). 
   - 

   

9. 

### **Changing Settings**

To change settings:

1. 
2. Press the **Parameter Button** to enter Parameter Editing Mode. 
3. 
4. Use the **Row Indicator Lights** to select the desired row (Timing, Switches, MIDI, Loops). 
5. 
6. Press the corresponding button for the parameter you want to edit. 
7. 
8. The current value of the parameter is displayed on the LoopTime Display. 
9. 
10. Continue pressing the button to cycle through available values or use the **Feedback Knob** (DataWheel) for faster editing. 
11. 
12. Press the **Parameter Button** again to exit Parameter Editing Mode.
13. 

### **Visual Tempo Guide** 

The front panel includes a **Visual Tempo Guide** to help you track the rhythm of your loop:

3. 

4. **Switches LED**: Blinks at cycle start points. 

5. 

6. **MIDI LED**: Blinks at loop start points (if multiples are established). 

7. 

8. Multiple Display Dots

   :

   - 
   - Right Dot: Blinks at the Global MIDI StartPoint. 
   - 
   - Left Dot: Indicates sync corrections. 
   - 

   

9. 

### **Key Points**

- 
- **Persistence of Memory**: All parameter changes are saved automatically and remain even after the unit is powered off. 
- 
- **Factory Reset**: Hold the **Parameter Button** while powering on to reset all parameters to their default values. 
- 
- **Status Indicators**: Provide clear visual cues for the state of each button and function. 
- 

The front panel is designed to be user-friendly, with clear visual indicators and intuitive controls for both live performance and parameter editing.

What happens during rever,se half time--  and during loop windowing and how to use it 

### **Reverse** 

#### **What Happens During Reverse** 

- 

- Functionality

  :

  - 
  - Reverse flips the playback direction of the current loop, causing the audio to play backward. 
  - 
  - Overdubs added during Reverse playback will play forward when the loop is flipped back to normal playback. 
  - 
  - The green Multiple Display counts cycles backward while the loop is reversed. 
  - 

  

- 

- Visual Cues

  :

  - 
  - The **Insert LED** turns red to indicate Reverse is active. 
  - 
  - The **LoopTime Display** briefly shows "rE" when Reverse is engaged and "Fd" when playback returns to forward. 
  - 

  

- 

- How to Use Reverse

  :

  1. 

  2. Activate Reverse

     :

     - 
     - Set **InsertMode=Reverse** to make the Insert button act as the Reverse button. 
     - 
     - Press the Insert button (or Reverse VirtualButton via MIDI) to toggle Reverse playback. 
     - 

     

  3. 

  4. Overdub in Reverse

     :

     - 
     - While the loop is reversed, press Overdub and play new material.  The overdub will play backward when the loop is flipped back to forward playback. 
     - 

     

  5. 

  6. Combine with Other Functions

     :

     - 
     - Reverse can be used to end Multiply or Insert operations, immediately flipping the loop direction after the function rounds off. 
     - 

     

  7. 

  8. Quantize Reverse

     :

     - 
     - If **Quantize=Cycle, Loop, or 8th**, Reverse playback begins at the next quantized point. 
     - 

     

  9. 

  

- 

### **HalfSpeed** 

#### **What Happens During HalfSpeed** 

- 

- Functionality

  :

  - 
  - HalfSpeed reduces the playback speed of the loop to half its normal speed, making the audio sound an octave lower and twice as long. 
  - 
  - Switching back to FullSpeed restores the original playback speed.
  - 
  - Overdubs added during HalfSpeed playback will play at normal speed when switched back to FullSpeed. 
  - 

  

- 

- Visual Cues

  :

  - 
  - The **Insert LED** turns red when HalfSpeed is active. 
  - 
  - The **LoopTime Display** briefly shows "H.SP" when HalfSpeed is engaged and "F.SP" when FullSpeed is restored. 
  - 

  

- 

- How to Use HalfSpeed

  :

  1. 

  2. Activate HalfSpeed

     :

     - 
     - Set **InsertMode=HalfSpeed** to make the Insert button act as the HalfSpeed button. 
     - 
     - Press the Insert button to toggle HalfSpeed playback. 
     - 

     

  3. 

  4. Overdub in HalfSpeed

     :

     - 
     - While the loop is playing at HalfSpeed, press Overdub and play new material. The overdub will play at normal speed when switched back to FullSpeed. 
     - 

     

  5. 

  6. Combine with Other Functions

     :

     - 
     - HalfSpeed can be used during Multiply or Insert operations to create interesting rhythmic and pitch effects. 
     - 

     

  7. 

  

- 

### **Loop Windowing** 

#### **What Happens During Loop Windowing**

- 

- Functionality

  :

  - 
  - Loop Windowing allows you to define a short segment (or "window") within a longer loop and repeat that segment as a new loop. 
  - 
  - The window can be moved backward through the loop memory, allowing you to explore earlier sections of the loop. 
  - 
  - You can resize the window dynamically to capture different-sized chunks of memory. 
  - 

  

- 

- Visual Cues

  :

  - 
  - The **Multiple Display** shows the cycle count of the new window. 
  - 
  - The **LoopTime Display** updates to reflect the length of the new window. 
  - 

  

- 

- How to Use Loop Windowing

  :

  1. 

  2. Create a Loop Window

     :

     - 

     - Perform a **Re-Multiply** or **Unrounded Multiply** to define the window. 

     - 

     - Re-Multiply

       :

       - 
       - Start Multiply on a loop with multiple cycles. 
       - 
       - Press Multiply again before the end of the loop to chop out a segment.  The new loop will be rounded to the previous cycle length. 
       - 

       

     - 

     - Unrounded Multiply

       :

       - 
       - Start Multiply and end it with Record to define a new loop length immediately (unrounded). 
       - 

       

     - 

     

  3. 

  4. Move the Window

     :

     - 

     - Press Undo to move the window backward through the loop memory. 

     - 

     - Short Undo

       :

       - 
       - Moves the window slightly backward, blending fragments of the loop. 
       - 

       

     - 

     - Long Undo

       :

       - 
       - Moves the window back by the full window length. 
       - 

       

     - 

     

  5. 

  6. Modify the Window

     :

     - 
     - Perform additional Re-Multiplies or Unrounded Multiplies to redefine the window size. 
     - 
     - Overdub new material onto the window to create variations. 
     - 

     

  7. 

  8. Combine with Other Functions

     :

     - 
     - Use Reverse, Multiply, or Insert within the window for creative effects. 
     - 

     

  9. 

  

- 

### **Key Notes**

- 
- **Reverse** and **HalfSpeed** are great for creating pitch and playback direction changes, while **Loop Windowing** is ideal for isolating and manipulating specific sections of a loop.
- 
- These functions can be combined with Overdub, Multiply, and Insert for advanced looping techniques.

  - The loop plays slower, and any overdubs added during HalfSpeed playback will sound normal when switched back to FullSpeed. 
  - 

  

- 

### **Scenario 2: Multiply with a Clock**

#### **What Happens When Using Multiply with an External Clock**

- 

- Synchronization

  :

  - 
  - Multiply works in sync with the external clock, ensuring that the resulting loop length is an integer multiple of the cycle length defined by the clock. 
  - 

  

- 

- Cycle Counting

  :

  - 
  - The **Multiple Display** counts the cycles as they are multiplied. 
  - 
  - For example, if the external clock defines a cycle length of **2.0 seconds** and you multiply the loop to **4 cycles**, the resulting loop length will be **8.0 seconds**. 
  - 

  

- 

- Quantization

  :

  - 
  - If **Quantize=Cycle**, Multiply will wait for the next cycle point before starting and ending the operation. 
  - 
  - If **Quantize=8th**, Multiply aligns to the nearest 8th note subdivision of the cycle. 
  - 

  

- 

- Visual Display

  :

  - 
  - During Multiply, the **LoopTime Display** shows the total loop length as it grows (e.g., 2.0 → 4.0 → 6.0 seconds). 
  - 
  - The **Multiple Display** increments to show the number of cycles (e.g., "C 1", "C 2", "C 3"). 
  - 

  

- 

- Overflow Handling

  :

  - 
  - If the multiplied loop exceeds the available memory, the operation is canceled, and the display shows "ooo" or an overflow error.
  - 

  

- 

### **Key Notes for Both Scenarios**

- 

- HalfSpeed

  :

  - 
  - The loop length doubles visually and audibly, but the memory usage remains the same.
  - 
  - Overdubs added during HalfSpeed playback will play at normal speed when switched back to FullSpeed. 
  - 

  

- 

- Multiply with Clock

  :

  - 
  - Multiply ensures rhythmic precision by aligning to the external clock's cycle length or subdivisions. 
  - 
  - The resulting loop length is always a multiple of the original cycle length, maintaining synchronization with the clock.
  -
