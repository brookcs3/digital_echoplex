### **1. SCOPING CONFLICTS INVENTORY - ECHOPLEX EMULATOR**
**Filename:** SCOPING CONFLICTS INVENTORY - ECHOPLEX EMULATOR.txt  
**Summary:**  
- **Root Cause:** Conflicts between Astro's CSS scoping mechanism and the Echoplex's hardware emulation state management.
- **Primary Symptom:** Record button toggle failure.
- **Scope:** 147+ instances of scoped class manipulation causing state sync issues.
- **Conflict Categories:**
  - LED state management conflicts.
  - Element selection dependencies.
  - CSS scoping architecture mismatches.
- **Critical Failure Points:**
  - Record button toggle mechanism.
  - Button event binding.
  - State persistence.
- **Recommendations:** 
  - Replace scoped class manipulation with CSS variables.
  - Use data attributes for state management.
  - Create a hardware emulation layer independent of CSS framework.

### **2. ASTRO-J7PV25F6 CLASS INVESTIGATION**
**Filename:** ASTRO-J7PV25F6 CLASS INVESTIGATION.txt  
**Summary:**  
- **Purpose:** Investigates the `astro-j7pv25f6` class, which is an Astro-generated scoped CSS class.
- **Findings:**
  - `astro-j7pv25f6` is not a functional class but a scoping mechanism to prevent CSS conflicts.
  - Ubiquitous presence across the application, affecting nearly every meaningful UI element.
  - All visual feedback depends on `astro-j7pv25f6` selectors.
- **Why It's Critical:**  
  - Ensures styling isolation for components.
  - Prevents global CSS from interfering with component-specific styling.
- **Recommendation:** Always include `astro-j7pv25f6` on elements that need component styling.
